(*====================================================================
Part 1: Flatland

Suppose we want to model a two-dimensional world called Flatland
populated by creatures of geometric shapes
(http://tiny.cc/cs51flatland).  In particular, we want:

- all shapes to have some notion of *area*, so that when we meet any
  new shape, we can easily calculate the shape's area.

- to know the shape's *location* in Flatland space.

- to support many different types of shapes.

How can we solve this problem?

There are several approaches. As a first attempt we might use
algebraic data types. (Later, we'll see this isn't quite ideal.)

First, we'll define a point to store (x, y) coordinates. *)

type point = float * float ;;

(* Now we'll define an algebraic data type for shapes (called
shape_adt) with the ability to represent some shapes: a Square, a
Rect, and a Circle. Each shape will have some aspects that together
specify its location and size, as follows:

Square: a single point for the location of its lower-left corner and
        an edge length.
Rect: a single point for the location of its lower-left corner, a
      width, and a height.
Circle: a single point for the location of its center and a radius.
 *)

type shape_adt =
  | Square of point * float
  | Rect of point * float * float
  | Circle of point * float ;;

(*....................................................................
Exercise 1A: Given the definitions above, write a function area_adt
that accepts a shape_adt and returns a float representing the area of
the shape.
....................................................................*)
let area_adt (s : shape_adt) : float =
  failwith "area_adt not implemented" ;;

(*....................................................................
Exercise 1B: Write a function that, given a list of elements of type
shape_adt, returns a list of areas corresponding to every shape.
....................................................................*)
    
let list_area_adt (lst : shape_adt list) : float list =
  failwith "list_area_adt not implemented" ;;

(*====================================================================
Part 2: Interfaces, Classes, Objects

Why is implementing shapes as an ADT not ideal?

Suppose you travel to Flatland and meet a new shape, Triangle. What
must change above to support the new shape?

The type definition of shape needs to change to include Triangle:

type shape_adt =
  | ...
  | Triangle of point * point * point

and the area function (and more generally, any function that used a
match statement on shape_adt) would need to change to include the
Triangle case:

let area (s : shape_adt) : float =
  match s with
  | ...
  | Triangle ... -> ...

Thus, extending our world of shapes tends to break a lot of different
parts of the code before it starts to work again. In real production
code, we may not always have access to all elements (we may not have
access to the type definition, for example, or the area function), so
adding new functionality in this manner may be difficult or
impossible.

As you might imagine, declaring all possible shapes up front is an
equally poor idea.

Using algebraic data types gives us a *closed* definition for all
possible types in this world; this means that we must know all
possible variants at the time of type definition.

We can resolve this difficulty with object-oriented programming.

Below, we've created a class type (or interface). Interfaces define
a new type and define *methods* for us to interact with this new type.

Once we have defined this class type, then we can always create new
shapes by defining *classes* that implement the shape interface. Below
is one such interface. *)

class type shape =
object
  (* The area of this shape *)
  method area : float

  (* The lower-left corner and the upper-right corner of the
     box that bounds the shape *)
  method bounding_box : point * point

  (* The center point of this shape *)
  method center : point

  (* Translates the shape by the offset specified in the point *)
  method translate : point -> unit

  (* Dilates the shape by the scale factor *)
  method scale : float -> unit
end ;;


(* This shape interface can have multiple classes implementing it, as so:

                        +------------+
                        |            |
                        |  shape (I) |
                        |            |
                        +--^---^---^-+
                           |   |   |
              implements   |   |   | implements
            +--------------+   |   +-------------+
            |                  |                 |
            |       implements |                 |
            |                  |                 |
     +------+------+     +-----+------+   +------+------+
     |             |     |            |   |             |
     |  square (C) |     | rect (C)   |   | circle (C)  |
     |             |     |            |   |             |
     +-------------+     +------------+   +-------------+

In the graphic above, an 'I' denotes a class type (interface) whereas
a 'C' denotes a concrete implementation of that interface. Concrete
classes implement an interface class type, which are denoted by arrows
and the label 'implements'.

Below, we'll create these classes that implement the shape class type.

A class is a specification for how to build objects; one analogy might
be to think of a class as a blueprint and an instance of the class as a
specific building created with that blueprint.

Classes include:
- Definitions of instance variables and methods. Each object, or
  instance, of a class has its own copy of instance variables.
- Information on how to construct & initialize objects.
- Scope information about what to hold private.

Here, the arguments to 'rect' represent *constructor* arguments:
values necessary to initialize the object.

Notice that the type of the 'rect' class is 'shape', or more properly,
the 'rect' class implements the 'shape' interface.

......................................................................
Exercise 2A: Implement the rect class. Consider: how do you store
the values provided by the constructor?
....................................................................*)

class rect (p : point) (w : float) (h : float) : shape =
object (this)

  (* instance variables that store the rect's properties *)
  val mutable pos = p      (* lower left corner of rectangle *)
  val mutable width = w
  val mutable height = h

  method area : float =
    failwith "rect area method not implemented"

  method bounding_box : point * point =
    failwith "rect bounding_box method not implemented"

  method center : point =
    failwith "rect center method not implemented"

  (* Destructively update pos to translate the shape by the values
     given in t. *)
  method translate (t : point) : unit =
    failwith "rect translate method not implemented"

  (* Scale the width and height of a rectangle from the lower-
     left corner. *)
  method scale (k : float) : unit =
    failwith "rect scale method not implemented"

end ;;

(*....................................................................
Exercise 2B: Implement the circle class. What would be the instance
variables for this shape?
....................................................................*)

class circle (c : point) (r : float) : shape =
object
  val mutable center = c
  val mutable radius = r

  method area : float =
    failwith "circle area method not implemented"

  method bounding_box : point * point =
    failwith "circle bounding_box method not implemented"

  method center : point =
    failwith "circle center method not implemented"

  (* Move the center of the circle by the values tx and ty. *)
  method translate ((tx, ty) : point) : unit =
    failwith "circle translate method not implemented"

  (* Scale the radius by k without moving its center. *)
  method scale (k : float) : unit =
    failwith "circle scale method not implemented"

end ;;

(*....................................................................
Exercise 2C: Implement the square class. Notice how similar it is to
rect! In this case, we've left its implementation entirely up to you.
....................................................................*)

class square (p : point) (s : float) : shape =
object(this)
  method area : float =
    failwith "square area method not implemented"

  method bounding_box : point * point =
    failwith "square bounding_box method not implemented"

  method center : point =
    failwith "square center method not implemented"

  (* Move the square by the values tx and ty. *)
  method translate ((tx, ty) : point) : unit =
    failwith "square translate method not implemented"

  (* Scale with width and height of a rectangle from the lower-
     left corner. *)
  method scale (k : float) : unit =
    failwith "square scale method not implemented"

end ;;

(* Recall one of the original motivations for these exercises. We
wanted to create a single area function that returns the area of any
shape. Let's discover how easy this is with our objects.

......................................................................
Exercise 2D: Create a function called area that accepts a shape object
and returns a float of the area for that shape.
....................................................................*)
let area (s : shape) : float =
  failwith "area not implemented" ;;

(*....................................................................
Exercise 2E: Create a list of instantiated shapes called s_list.
The list should contain, in order:
1. a rect at (1, 1) with width 4 and height 5
2. a circle at (0, -4) with radius 10
3. a square at (-3, -2.5) with size 4.3
....................................................................*)
   
let s_list = [] ;;

(* As you might recall, lists can only contain objects of the same
type.  Why does the type system not show an error with your answer to
2D?  What is the type of s_list? *)
   
(*====================================================================
Part 3: Representation, Inheritance

You might have noticed that rect and square are very similar
representations, or implementations, of a class. They both use a point
to represent a lower-left corner, and both take side length(s). A
square, as you know, is a rectangle with the additional constraint
that its width is equal to its height.

We can reimplement square to *inherit* from rect, and thus rely on
rect's existing representation.

In the end, we'll have this revised type hierarchy:

                        +------------+
                        |            |
                        |  shape (I) |
                        |            |
                        +--^---^---^-+
                           |   |   |
              implements   |   |   | implements
            +--------------+   |   +-------------+
            |                  |                 |
            |       implements |                 |
            |                  |                 |
     +------+------+     +-----+------+   +------+------+

     |  square (C) |     | rect (C)   |   | circle (C)  |
     |             |     |            |   |             |
     +-------------+     +-----^------+   +-------------+
                               |
                               | inherits
                               |
                      +--------+-------+
                      |                |
                      | square_rect (C)|
                      |                |
                      +----------------+

......................................................................
Exercise 3A: Implement the square_rect class which inherits all of its
methods from its parent.
....................................................................*)

(* UNCOMMENT ME AND COMPLETE
class square_rect (p : point) (s : float) : shape = ...
 *)

(*....................................................................
Exercise 3B: Now, implement a square_center_scale class that inherits
from square, but *overrides* the scale method so that the center
(rather than the lower-left corner) of the square stays in the same
place. Hint: First scale, then translate the center to its original
position.
....................................................................*)

(* UNCOMMENT ME AND COMPLETE
class square_center_scale (p: point) (s: float) : shape = ...
 *)
     
(* Before we move on, consider: do you need to make any modifications
to the area function you wrote in Exercise 2D to support these new
classes? *)

Part 4: Subtyping Polymorphism and Dynamic Dispatch

As we wander more around Flatland, we discover that there are more
four-sided shapes than we originally thought. We knew about Square
and Rect, but we've also seen Rhombi, Trapezoids, and other four-sided
creatures that are collectively called Quadrilaterals.

Since Square and Rect both like to identify themselves as
Quadrilaterals, which also identify themselves as Shapes, we need to
make Quadrilateral a *subtype* of Shape.

Below, we have defined a new class type (interface) called
'quad'. Notice that 'quad' has all of the methods in shape's
signature, but adds an additional method, 'sides', that returns the
lengths of each of the four sides.

Since quad can do everything that a shape can do (and thus, wherever
we expect a shape, we can safely pass a quad), we consider 'quad' a
*subtype* of 'shape'. *)

class type quad =
object
  inherit shape

  (* return the lengths of the four sides *)
  method sides : float * float * float * float
end ;;

(* Here is our revised type hierarchy:

                        +------------+

due to subtyping and inheritance we can still rely on the existing
implementation you already created.

(* This works because of *dynamic dispatch*; we decide the code to run
   at run-time instead of compile-time. In other words, the shape#area
   call in the area function determines at run-time the specific
   method to call based on the object, s, passed to it.

   Compare this to the area_adt function, which is not dynamic because
   the same code is run every time. Even though the match case may not
   be known, the branch is wholly contained within that static
   function. *)
